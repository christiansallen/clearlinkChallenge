        <p class="summary-text">Hi, I'm Christian Allen, a UX-oriented web developer. I have a over a year's worth of web-development experience and I graduated from Lambda School, a 30-week coding bootcamp. I'm thankful for this opportunity to complete your code challenge.</p>

          <h2 class='question-header'>What makes you nervous?</h2 class='question-header'>
          <p class='answer'>I feel nervous when I don't know something I should. Throughout my experience with coding, there were multiple times where I felt like I should've known something, but didn't. The only way to get rid of that nervous feeling, for me, was to learn those particular subjects and feel confident in them.</p>

          <h2 class='question-header'>What has been your greatest moment as a developer?</h2>
          <p class='answer'>My greatest moment as a developer was creating <a href="https://projectfirefly.netlify.com/" style='text-decoration:none; color: blue;'>Project Firefly</a> with other developers and UX designers. We were able to create a web application that can potentially become a funded company. <br> It's my greatest moment because I didn't know how we were going to complete the application in such a short time, but we did. Proving myself wrong helped make this my greatest coding achievement so far.</p>
